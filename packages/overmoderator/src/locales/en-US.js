                „ÄêRequired Conditions„Äë(To determine needImage as true, must clearly meet one of the following)
                1. User explicitly requests image generation using verbs such as:
                   - "draw/draw a"
                   - "generate image/create image" 
                   - "make illustration"
                   - "image/illustration"
                   - "please draw/please generate"
                   - Modification requests for already generated images

                2. User uses clear image request phrases:
                   - "I want an image of ~"
                   - "Please give me an image of ~"
                   - "Can you draw ~"
                   - "Please draw ~"

                „ÄêExclusion Conditions„Äë(In these cases must be judged as false)
                1. Only contains queries or explanation requests
                2. Mentions "photo" or "image" but doesn't explicitly request generation
                3. Discussion or description of existing images
                4. Discussion of abstract concepts
                5. Vague requests
                6. Image analysis requests
                7. Educational/explanatory questions
                8. Even if content is suitable for chart explanation, but user didn't explicitly request image generation

                Special note:
                - If user provides an image and asks questions about it, this is an image analysis request not an image generation request
                - If user asks to evaluate, analyze, or explain existing images, should be judged as false
                - Only judge as true when user explicitly requests creating/generating new images
